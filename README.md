# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether there was any bias towards reviews written by paid reviewers from the Vine program at Amazon. One might hypothesize that customers being paid to complete a review would complete a more favorable review than their unpaid counterparts. The results below reflect whether there is evidence in support.

### Results:
The results below show little evidence that there was bias.

* <b>Total Vine reviews v. Non-vine reviews</b>: The total number of reviews completed by paid customers was 61,807 versus a figure of 61,474 from unpaid. This is a difference of just 333 reviews, and a decrease of less than 1% from the total number of paid.
* <b>5-star review comparison</b>: The number of five-star reviews varied little between paid (32,785) and unpaid (32,646) reviewers.
* <b>Percentage of 5-star reviews comparison</b>: As the figures above suggest, there was little variance between the percentage of 5-star reviews by reviewer type (paid/unpaid). Around 53% of both Vine and non-Vine reviewers gave 5-star reviews. Interestingly, a slightly higher percentage of non-Vine reviewers gave 5-star ratings.

### Summary: 
It does not appear that there is any positivity bias in the Vine program. The comparison figures were strikingly similar, in fact. To provide more evidence in favor of this conclusion, we could run a Chi-squared test. The results would evaluate how likely the observed statistics would be assuming there is no bias (which would be our null hypothesis).
